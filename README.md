This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon error in Haskell related to unsafe handling of Maybe values. The `bug.hs` file contains code with an unsafe access to a Maybe, which can lead to runtime crashes. The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a corrected version using safe pattern matching.
