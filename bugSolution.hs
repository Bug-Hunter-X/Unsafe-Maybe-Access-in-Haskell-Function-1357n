The issue is addressed by replacing the unsafe `fromJust` call with pattern matching.  This approach elegantly handles both the Just and Nothing cases, preventing runtime crashes.

```haskell
processMaybe :: Maybe Int -> Int
processMaybe (Just x) = x * 2
processMaybe Nothing = 0 -- Handle the Nothing case gracefully
```

This revised function safely processes Maybe values, providing a default value of 0 when the Maybe is Nothing.  Pattern matching is a cornerstone of functional programming in Haskell, offering both conciseness and safety.
